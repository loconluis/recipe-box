## Recipe Box

This is a [Freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/build-a-recipe-box) project idea to practice with React, but not submited.

It is a small application, to store the ingredients of any recipe. [Demo](https://recipe-box.now.sh/)

For this project I used the [Reactstrap](http://reactstrap.github.io/) library to use bootstrap components

## Development
```
$ git clone repo
$ git cd recipe-box
$ git yarn start

```
